# Library Database Project ðŸ“š

Hey there!  
This repo is for my Database Management task where I created a **Library Management System** schema using SQL.

## What this project includes:
- SQL script to create all the tables (like Library, Books, Authors, Members, Staff, etc.)
- ER Diagram to show how all tables are connected
- This README to explain everything

## Tools I used:
-  SQLiteStudio 
- GitHub to upload my project

## How to use:
1. Open your SQL tool (like MySQL Workbench or SQLiteStudio)
2. Copy-paste or run the `library_schema.sql` file
3. The tables will be created, and relationships will be set
4. You can now insert sample data or run queries on it!

## Files in this repo:
- `library_schema.sql` â†’ SQL code to create tables and relationships
- `er_diagram.png` â†’ Screenshot of the ER diagram (if available)
- `README.md` â†’ This file
